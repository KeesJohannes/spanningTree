# spanningTree
Minimum distance cluster (tree)

A minimum spanning network is a useful graphical representation consisting of the shortest links required to connect all members of a matrix of genetic distances.

Such a distance matrix can easily be generated by a LAMP (Linux, Apache, Mysql, PHP) webserver in response to the request of a webbrowser.

The script presented here transforms the generated HTML distance-table stante pede into an SVG image of a corresponding minimum spanning network.

I wrote this implementation of Prim's algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm) in Javascript.

The script will be used in the EuseqMyTb pilot-project for tracing the transmission of drug-resistant *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* in Europe.
